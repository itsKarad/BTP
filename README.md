# Safety Platform
## Aim

To build a platform which raises awareness & educates users about safety guidelines, safety regulations & standard specifications, where anyone can contribute information.

All information will be seperated into different sections depending on the topic and can be easily found by search.

We aim to build a Wikipedia like contribution system, where users can contribute to any page, and can also edit or delete it later. This information is accessible to the relevant users by search and filters.
